# File Parser - Log Analysis

## Overview

This C# console application reads and parses log entries containing timestamps, event types, and messages. The program can print all logs, count occurences of each event type, and identify the top 3 most frequent messages associated with a specific event type.

This project utilizes strong Object-Oriented Programming principles through clear seperation of concerns between log parsing, data representation, and log analysis.
